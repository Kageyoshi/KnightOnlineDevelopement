KnightOnlineDevelopement
========================

Public releases to knight online developement.

I will be creating a lot of stuff, different stuff, for knight online private server. The version of server I will be
posting to is 1298. You may ask why? Well I do not know C++ or any other advanced programming language so I am going
to do the stuff that I know which is messing with databases (SQL), creating applications for server management (Visual
Basic) and many other stuff that is connected with server developing like writing quests in Evt, editing Tables in client,
creating items, improving skills etc.

Well all you really need to do is wait :)
